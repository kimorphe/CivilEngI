\section{Basics of Truss Structures}
\subsection{Introduction}
Bridges are fabricated by joining plates, bars, and cables of various sizes. The parts making up a bridge structure are called structural members. In this lecture, we focus on the mechanics of slender bar-like structural members. By "bar", we mean a slender object for which an evident longitudinal axis exists. The cross-sectional area of the bar may or may not be uniform in the axial direction. No assumption is made either regarding the shape of the cross-section. By joining bars, we can build a bridge structure called a truss. In this context, we often call the bars as truss members. In Fig.\ref{fig:fig1}, examples of truss structures are shown. The truss structures in this figure bear the name of their inventors. Truss structures are characterized by a triangular assemblage of the members. The major advantage of the truss structure is weights. Trusses are often lighter in weight than girder bridges, which are the most prevalent bridge structure best suited to short-span bridges. In designing truss structures, we need to address the following issues.
%DONE
\begin{itemize}
\item
	How is the whole truss structure supported ?
\item
	How to connect two or more truss members at the joints ?
\item
	How much force each truss member has to bear ?
\end{itemize}
Those are the topics of this lecture to be discussed in some detail.

	\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Support Condition and Reaction Forces}
There are three support conditions that are basic in structural mechanics. 
Those are 
\begin{itemize}
\item
	fixed (or clamped) support,
\item
	pin (or hinge) support, and 
\item
	roller support.
\end{itemize}
For each of the three support condition, we will look at the constraints that a support 
imposes to a body. In doing so, we need not be specific about the geometry of the 
supported object. For simplicity, therefore, we'll study the interaction between 
the supports and a single straight bar. 
\subsubsection{Fixed support}
When a bar is fixed to a rigid and immobile wall as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a), 
we say the bar is held by a "fixed" or "clamped" support. 
At a fixed support, we assume that the translational and rotational motion 
are completely restrained. In the setup shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a),  
the horizontal, vertical, and rotational displacement at the left end of 
the bar are therefore not allowed at all. To see how the fixed support works, 
suppose that the bar is under a vertical force as illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a).
In reaction to the loading, the support applies a force and probably moment as well.   
The force and moment applied by a support called reaction force and reaction moment, respectively. 
The reaction force and moment are required to statically support the bar by 
equilibrating the total forces and moments. 
To see this, assume that the bar is subjected to the reaction forces and  moment 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(b)). Then the equilibrium conditions for the horizontal 
and vertical forces are written as 
\begin{equation}
	H=0, \ \ F-V=0, 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
and for the moment about A as 
\begin{equation}
	M+F\times l =0.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
As a result, the equilibrium conditions can be satisfied if and only if 
the reaction forces such as  
\begin{equation}
	H=0, \ \ V=F, \ \ M=-Fl. 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
are applied to the bar. In the foregoing discussion, however,   
we have not shown how to generate the reaction moment $M$ independently  
from the reaction force. 
The simplest solution to this problem is to apply a couple of forces 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig6} where $K$ and $\varepsilon$ are 
constants such that 
\begin{equation}
	M=K\varepsilon.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Note that the sum of the two forces consisting the couple vanishes. 
This means we can generate a pure moment of arbitrary magnitude.
For given $M$, however, we cannot determine $K$ and $\varepsilon$ uniquely. 
We thus have to be content with specifying only $M$ rather than $F$ and $\varepsilon$. 
This is why we have drawn the reaction moment in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3} instead of the 
couple of forces.

	\end{center}
	\caption{Generation of a pure moment by a couple of forces.} 
	\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Pin support}
At a pin support, the bar is connected to a fixture with a hinge 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig7}. Around the hinge, the bar may rotate 
freely and smoothly. Since the support itself is fixed to an immobile 
floor or a wall, the bar is not allowed to move in any directions at the 
pin support.  This means pin supports apply the horizontal and vertical 
reaction forces in reaction to the loading. On the other hand, the reaction 
moment does not arise because the bar can rotate freely about the hinges. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig7.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Pin supports installed on a floor and wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig7}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Roller support}
Figure \ref{fig:fig8} illustrates the roller supports installed on a floor and a wall. 
As depicted in this figure, the roller supports consists of a hinge and roller. 
The hinge allows the bar to rotate freely as the pin supports do. 
The roller allows the bar to slide freely along the wall or floor.  
Consequently, it is assumed that the roller supports do not apply 
the reaction moment nor the reaction force in the sliding direction. 
When a roller support is installed to a vertical wall, for example, the vertical 
 displacement may take place freely at the support while the horizontal displacement 
is not allowed. In this case, therefore, the roller support generate only the horizontal 
reaction force. When the roller support is installed on a horizontal floor, 
the support prevents the vertical motion while the horizontal 
displacement takes place freely. This means the roller support works in this case 
as a source of vertical reaction force.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig8.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{The roller supports installed on an immobile floor and a wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig8}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Simple support}
The combination of the roller and pin support is called simple support. 
When a bar is supported by a pin support at one end and by a roller 
support at the other end, we say the bar is simply supported. 
When a bar is simply supported, we can determine the reaction forces 
based on the equilibrium conditions for the force and moment. 
To see this, consider a simply supported bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_2}
subjected to an angled load of magnitude $F$.
The pin support at the left end applies both the vertical and horizontal reaction forces 
since the displacements in those directions are constrained.
At the right end of the bar, the rotation and lateral motion are allowed.
Thus, the roller support at the right end applies only a vertical reaction force.
Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_1} shows the non-vanishing reaction forces and the external 
force at the center of the bar. The diagram showing the forces acting to a body or 
a portion of the body is called a free body diagram. Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_1} is an example 
of the free body diagram for a simply supported bar.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig3_2.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported bar AC subjected to an angled force of magnitude $F$.}
	\label{fig:fig3_2}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig3_1.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		A free body diagram for a simply supported bar.
		$F, H_A, V_A, V_C$ and $|\fat{f}|=F$ denote the magnitude of forces.
	}
	\label{fig:fig3_1}
\end{figure}
Referring to the free body diagram, we can write the equilibrium equations as follows. 
With respect to the point $A$, the equilibrium condition for the moment is written as  
\[
	-F\sin\frac{\pi}{4}\times \frac{l}{2} + V_C\times l =0.
\]
Thus we have $V_C=\frac{F}{2\sqrt{2}}$. The equilibrium of the horizontal force gives
\[
	H=F\cos\frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Finally, the sum of vertical forces requires 
\[
	F\sin\frac{\pi}{4} -(V_A+V_C)=0, 
\]
which determines $V_A$ as 
\[
	V_A=\frac{F}{2\sqrt{2}}.
\]
\subsection{Pin Connection}
A point where two or more truss members are joined together is called a joint or node. 
At a joint, truss members are connected either by a gusset plate or a hinge as depicted 
in Fig.\ref{fig:fig4}. The former is called a rigid connection whereas the latter is called 
a pin connection. At a rigidly connected joint, the truss members are joined 
tightly by a gusset plate that the angles between the truss members do not 
change upon loading. This means both force and moment can be transmitted across 
the rigid joints from one member to another. 
At a pin connection, on the other hand, the truss members can rotate freely about 
the joint. In other words, pin connected joints do not bear a moment, and 
only a force can be transmitted across the pin connected joints. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig4.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A rigid and pin connections joining two truss members.} 
	\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

The load bearing mechanism of the structures changes significantly whether the 
structural members are joined rigidly or pin connected. To see this, let's first 
examine a truss member with the rigidly connected ends. When a truss structure is externally loaded, 
the force and moments are transmitted throughout the structure if the 
members are joined rigidly. As a result, every truss member is subjected to 
the force and moment at the joints even if the external load is not applied 
directly to it. To describe the loading condition more precisely, let's 
denote the moment and forces in the axial and transverse directions 
acting at a bar's ends as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig5}-(a). 
There are six components of force and moment in this figure. 
However, those six components are  mutually not  independent since 
the equilibrium conditions must be satisfied. 
Regarding the axial and transverse forces, we have 
\begin{equation}
	N_A-N_B=0, \ Q_A-Q_B=0, .
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
thus we can introduce independent axial and transverse force components $N$ and $Q$ as
\begin{equation}
	N=N_A=N_B,\  Q=Q_A=Q_B.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Moreover, the equilibrium condition for moment about $A$ gives 
\begin{equation}
	M_A-M_B+Q_Bl=0 
	\label{eqn:equib_Mab}
\end{equation}
reducing the number of independent components to three(i.e. $N,Q$ and $M_A$ or $M_B$).\\

When the truss member $AB$ is pin connected at both ends, the 
number of independent components of the nodal force and moment can be reduced further. 
By assumption, the pin connected joints do not bear moment. Hence   
\begin{equation}
		M_A=M_B=0, 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
which reduces eq.(\ref{eqn:equib_Mab}) to $Q=0$.
In conclusion, we have 
\begin{equation}
	N_A=N_B=N,\  Q_A=Q_B=0, \  M_A=M_B=0.
	\label{eqn:sec_forces}
\end{equation}
for pin connected truss members.  
%This means that the truss members transmit only the axial forces if they are connected at both ends by hinges. 
As we shall see in the next section, eq.(\ref{eqn:sec_forces}) greatly simplifies the analyses of truss structures.

\subsection{Analysis of Truss Structure}
One of the primary objectives of the analysis of truss structure is to determine 
the axial forces in truss members when the truss is externally loaded. 
Evaluating the axial forces is important because excessive axial force leads to a  
failure of the member and/or the structure. When a pin-connected truss is simply supported, 
the axial forces in the truss members can be determined by imposing the equilibrium condition 
node by node. There are other approaches to this problem.  
However the node-by-node method is the simplest (not the most efficient in many cases unfortunately). 
To learn the node-by-node approach, let's consider obtaining axial forces in the truss shown in 
Fig.\ref{fig:fig9}.\\ 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig9.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported truss.} 
	\label{fig:fig9}
\end{figure}
The analysis of truss structure usually start with the identification of 
external forces acting to the structure including reaction forces. 
In the present example, the horizontal force at node $C$ of magnitude $F$ 
is the given external load. The reaction forces are not known. 
However, we have already learned how we can use the equilibrium equations to 
in determining the reaction forces for a simply supported bar. 
If we consider the equilibrium conditions for the whole structure, 
we can similarly obtain the reaction forces for simply supported truss structures 
as well. To take this approach, we first draw a free body diagram as shown in 
Fig.\ref{fig:fig9}-(a) where $H_A, V_A$ and $V_B$ are the horizontal 
or vertical components of the reaction forces. The arrows in this figure 
indicate the direction when the force vector components take positive values. 
The equilibrium equations of the forces and moment are then written as 
\begin{equation}
	F+H_A=0, \ \ V_A+V_B=0, \ \ -F\times l\sin\frac{\pi}{3}+V_B\times l=0. 
	\label{eqn:equib_whole}
\end{equation}
Thus we have 
\begin{equation}
	H_A=-F, \ \ V_A=-V_B=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}F
	\label{eqn:reac_frc}
\end{equation}
Note that the total moment about $A$ has been considered in the third equation of (\ref{eqn:equib_whole}).

Given the reaction forces $H_A, V_A$ and $V_B$, we are ready to determine the axial forces. 
For the analysis of axial force, it is convenient to number the truss members as 
shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig8}-(a), and denote the axial forces of the $i$th truss member 
as $N_i$ where $i$ assumes 1,2 or 3. 
In the following analysis, it is important to note that tensile axial force is taken to be 
positive while compressional force to be negative. If a truss member is bearing a tensile axial 
force, therefore, we can tell that the truss member is being pulled by the joints at its ends.
By the law of action and reaction (Newton's 3rd law), this implies that the truss member under  
tensile axial force is pulling the joints at its end. To make the discussion clearer, 
let's look at the truss member 1. As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig10}-(a), the truss member 1 is 
connected to node A and B. Hence, it pulls together the nodes A and B if $N_1>0$ and 
 pushes apart if $N_1<0$. 
 Since the same observation applies to the truss members 2 and 3, we can draw 
 the forces that act to each node (joints) of the truss as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig9}-(b).
It should be noted here that Fig.\ref{fig:fig10} depicts the forces acting to the node not 
the truss members, which is why the truss members are drawn by dashed lines there. 
By imposing the equilibrium conditions for horizontal and vertical forces node by node, 
we can determine the axial forces. This procedure goes as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
	Node $A$: \\
	The equilibrium equations of the horizontal and vertical forces at node $A$
	are written respectively as 
	\begin{equation}
		N_1+H_A+N_2\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_2\sin\alpha+V_A=0
		\label{eqn:nodeA}
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha=\frac{\pi}{3}$. Solving eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeA}). 
	Thus we have $N_1=\frac{F}{2}$ and $N_2=F$. 
\item
	Node $B$: \\
	It follows from the equilibrium condtions for node B written as 
	\begin{equation}
		N_1+N_3\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_3\sin\alpha+V_B=0
		\label{eqn:nodeB}
	\end{equation}
	that we have $N_1=\frac{F}{2}$ and $N_3=-F$.
	We can verify that the axial force for member 1 from eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeA}) 
	agrees with that given from eq.(\ref{eqn:nodeB}).
\item
	Node $C$: \\
	The equilibrium conditions for node C are written as 
	\begin{equation}
		F-N_1\cos\alpha+N_3\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_2\sin\alpha+N_3\sin\alpha=0.
		\label{eqn:nodeC}
	\end{equation}
	Since we have already determined all the axial forces, eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeC}) are redundant.  
	However, it is a good practice to verify the solutions using a redundant 
	but independently derived relations that should be satisfied.  
	In this problem, we can verify that our solutions $N_1,N_2$ and $N_3$ do 
	satisfy eq.(\ref{eqn:nodeC}).
\end{enumerate}
As it has been shown, two equations are available for every nodal point, which 
means we can determine up to two axial forces per node. 
If more than two members are connected to a node, it is not possible to 
determine the axial forces of those members all at once. 
In that case, you should postpone imposing equilibrium condition to that 
node until at least one of the axial forces involved is determined 
as a result of the analysis on neighboring nodes.

\subsection{Solved Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Consider a simply supported bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_3}, and 
determine the reaction forces at the supports A and B.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig3_3.eps}

	\caption{A simply supported bar subjected to a vertical force of magnitude $F$.}
	\label{fig:fig3_3}
\end{figure}
{\small
	A free body diagram for the simply supported bar is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig15}. 
	The horizontal and vertical components of the reaction forces are denoted in
	this figure as $H_A, V_A$ and $V_B$.
	The equilibrium equations for the reaction force components are 
	\[
		H_A=0, \ \ V_A+V_B=F, 
	\]
	and 
	\[
		-F\times a +V_B\times l =0
	\]
	where the last equation is concerned with the moment about $A$.
	From the set of equations above, we obtain
	\[
		H_A=0, \ \ V_A=\frac{b}{l}F, \ \ V_B=\frac{a}{l}F.
	\]

	\caption{A free body diagram for the bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_3}.} 
	\label{fig:fig15}
	\end{figure}
\item
Examine two support conditions shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_4}, 
and determine whether all the reaction forces and moments can 
be determined by the equilibrium equations. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig3_4.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A straight bar in two support conditions.} 
	\label{fig:fig3_4}
\end{figure}
{\small
	The free body diagrams for the two support conditions are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig16}. 
	As shown in this figure, the total number of unknown reaction force components are  
	6 for (a) and 4 for (b) whereas the number of equilibrium equations 
	available are three. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the 
	reaction force components based only on the equilibrium conditions since 
	the number of unknowns is greater than constraining equations.  
	When reaction forces can be determined by the equilibrium equations, 
	we say the structure is statically determinate. Otherwise, the structure is 
	called statically indeterminate. The structures shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_4} are 
	 examples of statically indeterminate structures.

\end{figure}
\item
	Determine the reaction and axial forces acting to the simply supported 
	truss shown in Fig.\ref{fig:13}.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{A simply supported truss. } 
	\label{fig:fig13}
\end{figure}
{\small 
	We first assign a unique number to each truss member, and draw 
	a free body diagram as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig14}-(a) to 
	obtain the reaction forces in the first place. 
	If we notice that the line of action of the force at $D$ passes the node $A$, 
	the equilibrium of the moment about $A$ is written as  
	\[
		V_B\times l =0.
	\]
	Given $V_B=0$, the equilibrium equations: 
	\[ 
		H_A+F\cos\alpha =0 , \ \ V_A+V_B+F\sin\alpha=0, \ \ \left( \alpha=\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
	\]
	for the horizontal and vertical reaction forces give
	\[
		H_A=V_A=-\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}, \ \ V_B=0.
	\]

	To determine the axial forces one by one, we draw a diagram 
	that shows the forces acting to each nodes as shown 
	in Fig.\ref{fig:fig14}. In this figure, the axial force of the $i$th 
	truss member is denoted as $N_i$.
	In imposing equilibrium conditions going through the nodes one by one, 
	we need to start with the node to which two truss members are connected.
	If we start with node $D$, the equilibrium conditions give
	\[ 
		N_4=N_5=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}.
	\]
	If we start from node $A$ instead, we obtain
	\[
		N_1=-H_A=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}, \ \ 
		N_2=-V_A=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}
	\]
	Either way, the equilibrium equations for node $C$ and $D$ are made 
	solvable as a result of the analysis either or both on node $A$ and $D$.
	The equilibrium equations for the node $C$ are given by 
	\[
		N_5+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0, \ \ 
		N_2+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0
	\]
	whereas for node $D$ by
	\[
		N_4+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}+V_B=0, \ \ 
		N_1+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0.
	\]
	From the set of equations presented above, we obtain $N_3=-F$.

\item
	Examine the bars shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig12} under a vertical load 
	of magnitude $F$, and answer whether the reaction forces and 
	moment can be determined by the equilibrium conditions.
	If the answer is positive, obtain the reaction forces and moment.
