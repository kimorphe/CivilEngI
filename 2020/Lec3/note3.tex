\section{Basics of Truss Structures}
\subsection{Introduction}
A bridge structure is assembled by joining plates, bars, and cables of various sizes.
The parts making up a bridge structure are called structural members.
In this lecture, we focus on the mechanics of slender bar-like structural 
members. By "bar", we mean a slender object for which an evident longitudinal 
axis exists. The cross sectional area of the bar may or may not be uniform
in the axial direction. No assumption is made regarding the shape of the cross section.
By joining bars, we can build a bridge structure called truss. 
In this context, we call the bar-like structural member as a truss member. 
Fig.\ref{fig:fig1} shows examples of truss stuctures. 
The truss structures shown in this figure bear the name of their inventors. 
Truss structures are characterized by a triangular assemblage of the members. 
The major advantage of the truss structure is weight. 
Truss structures are often lighter in weight than girder bridges, which 
is the most prevalent bridge structure best suited to short-span bridges.
In designing truss structures, we need to address the following issues.
\begin{itemize}
\item
	How is the whole truss strcture supported ?
\item
	How to connect two or more truss members at the joints ?
\item
	How much force each truss member has to bear ?
\end{itemize}
Those are the topics of this lecture to be discussed in some detail. 
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Examples of truss structures. (a) Warren truss, (b) Howe truss, and (c) Pratt truss.} 
	\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Support Condition and Reaction Forces}
There are three support condtions that are basic in structural mechanics. 
Those are 
\begin{itemize}
\item
	fixed (or clamped) support,
\item
	pin (or hinge) support, and 
\item
	roller support.
\end{itemize}
For each of the three support condition, we will look at the constraints that a support 
imposes to a body. In doing so, we need not be specific about the geometry of the 
supported object. For simplicity, therefore, we'll study the interaction between 
the supports and a single straight bar. 
\subsubsection{Fixed support}
When a bar is fixed to a rigid and immobile wall as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a), 
we say the bar is held by a "fixed" or "clamped" support. 
At a fixed support, we assume that the translational and rotational motion 
are completely restraied. In the setup shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a),  
the horizontal, vertical, and rotational displacement at the left end of 
the bar are therefore not allowed at all. To see how the fixed support works, 
suppose that the bar is under a vertical force as illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a).
In reaction to the loading, the support applies a force and probably moment as well.   
The force and moment applied by a support called reaction force and reaction moment, respectively. 
The reaction force and moment are required to statically support the bar by 
equilibrating the total forces and moments. 
To see this, assume that the bar is subjected to the reaction forces and  moment 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(b)). Then the equilibrium condtions for the horizontal 
and vertical forces are written as 
\begin{equation}
	H=0, \ \ F-V=0, 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
and for the moment about A as 
\begin{equation}
	M+F\times l =0.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
As a result, the equilbrium conditions can be satisfied if and only if 
the reaction forces such as  
\begin{equation}
	H=0, \ \ V=F, \ \ M=-Fl. 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
are applied to the bar. In the foregoing discussion, however,   
we have not shown how to generate the reaction moment $M$ independently  
from the reaction force. 
The simplest solution to this problem is to apply a couple of forces 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig6} where $K$ and $\varepsilon$ are 
constants such that 
\begin{equation}
	M=K\varepsilon.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Note that the sum of the two forces consisting the cuple vanishes. 
This means we can generate a pure moment of arbitray magnitude.
For given $M$, however, we cannot determine $K$ and $\varepsilon$ uniquely. 
We thus have to be content with specifying only $M$ rather than $F$ and $\varepsilon$. 
This is why we have drawn the reaction moment in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3} instead of the 
couple of forces.

	\end{center}
	\caption{Generation of a pure moment by a couple of forces.} 
	\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Pin support}
At a pin support, the bar is connected to a fixture with a hinge 
as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig7}.
Around the hinge, the bar may rotate freely and frictionlessly.
Since the support itself is fixed to an immobile floor or a wall, 
the bar is not allowed to move in any directions at the pin support. 
This means pin supports generate the horizontal and vertical 
reaction forces in reaction to the loading.
On the other hand, the reaction moment does not arise 
because pin supports let the bar rotate freely about the hinges. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig7.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Pin supports installed on a floor and wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig7}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Roller support}
Figure \ref{fig:fig8} illustrates the roller supports installed on a floor 
and a wall. As depicted in this figure, roller supports consists of 
a hinge and a roller. The hinge allows the bar to rotate freely as pin 
supports do. The roller allows the bar to slide freely along the wall or floor.  
Consequently, we assume that the roller supports do not generate 
the reaction moment nor the reaction force in the sliding direction. 
 When a roller support is installed to a wall, for example, vertical 
 dipacelement may take place at the support while horizontal displacement 
may not. In this case, therefore, the roller support provide only the horizontal 
reaction force. When the roller support is installed on a floor, 
the support prevents the vertical motion while letting the horizontal 
displacement takes place freely. This means the roller support works as a source 
of vertical reaction force.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig8.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{The roller supports installed on an immobile floor and a wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig8}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Simple support}
When a bar is supported by a pin support at one end and by a roller 
support by the other end, we say the bar is simply supported. 
The combination of the roller and pin support is called simple support. 
When a bar is simply supported, we can determine the reaction forces 
from the equilibirium conditions for the force and moment. 
To see this, consider a simply supported bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_2}
subjected to an angled load.
The pin support at the left end applies both the vertical and horizontal reaction forces 
since the motion except rotation is constrained at the left end.
At the right end of the bar, the rotation and lateral motion are allowed.
Only a vertical reaction force arises at the right end. 
Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_1} shows the non-vanishing reaction forces with the external 
force at the center of the bar. The diagram showing the forces acting to a body or 
a portion of the body is called free body diagram. Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_1} is an example 
of the free body diagram for a simply supported bar.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig3_2.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported bar AC subjected to an oblique force of magnitude $F$.}
	\label{fig:fig3_2}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig3_1.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		A free body diagram for a simply supported bar.
		$F, H_A, V_A, V_C$ and $|\fat{f}|=F$ denote the magnitude of forces.
	}
	\label{fig:fig3_1}
\end{figure}
The equilbirium conditon for the moment about $A$ is 
\[
	-F\sin\frac{\pi}{4}\times \frac{l}{2} + V_C\times l =0,
\]
Thus we have $V_C=\frac{F}{2\sqrt{2}}$. The equilibrium of the horizontal force 
gives us 
\[
	H=F\cos\frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Finally, the equilbirium of vertical forces requires 
\[
	F\sin\frac{\pi}{4} -(V_A+V_C)=0
\]
determines $V_A$ as 
\[
	V_A=\frac{F}{2\sqrt{2}}.
\]
\subsection{Pin Connection}
A point where two or more truss members are joined together is called a joint or node. 
At a joint,  truss members are connected either by a gasset plate or a hinge as depicted 
in Fig.\ref{fig:fig4}. The former is called a rigid connection whereas the latter is called 
a pin connection. At a rigidly connected  joint, the truss members are joined 
so tightly by a gasset plate that the angles between the truss members do not 
change upon loading. This means both force and moment can be transmitted across 
the rigid joints from one member to another. 
At a pin connection, on the other hand, the truss members joined by a hinge may rotate 
freely about the joint. In other words, the pin connected joint does not bear a moment. 
The consequence is important in the analyses of truss structure. 

If we look at a truss member with rigidly connected ends, 
the force and the moments work on both ends. This is the case 
even thought the trusss member is not directly loaded by external forces. 
When the structure and the structural members are in static equilibrium, the 
equilibrium condtions must be met, which requires
\begin{equation}
	N_A-N_B=0, \ Q_A-Q_B=0, \  M_A-M_B+Q_Bl=0 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}
and thus we have
\begin{equation}
	N_A=N_B=N,\  Q_A=Q_B=Q, \  M_A-M_B=Ql.
	\label{eqn:sec_forces}
\end{equation}
where $N$ and $Q$ are called axial and shear force, respectively.
When the truss member is connected to pins at both ends, then 
$M_A=M_B=0$ by assumption. This reduces to eq.(\ref{eqn:sec_forces}) 
to 
\begin{equation}
	N_A=N_B=N,\  Q_A=Q_B=0, \  M_A=M_B=0.
	\label{eqn:sec_forces}
\end{equation}
This means that the truss members transmit only the axial forces 
 if they are connected at both ends by hinges. As we will see, this 
 greatly simplifies the analyses of truss structures.

\subsection{Analysis of Truss Structure}
One of the primary objectives of the analysis of truss structure is to determine 
the axial forces in truss members generated due to  the extrnal load. 
Evaluation of the axial forces is important because the excessive axial force leads to the 
failure of the member and/or the structure.
When a pin-connected truss is simply supported, the reaction forces from the supports and the 
axial forces in the truss members can be determined from the equilbrium conditions of forces. 
To obtain the axial forces, we're going to impose equilbrium conditions node by node.   
There are two other approaches to this problem. However the node-by-node method is the simplest. 
To study this approach, consider determining axial forces in the truss shown in 
Fig.\ref{fig:fig9}. This is one of the simplest truss structures of all, but it can serve as a 
canonical problem in learning the node-by-node method.\\ 


\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig9.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported truss.} 
	\label{fig:fig9}
\end{figure}
The analysis of truss structure usually start with the identification of 
external forces that act to the structure. 
The external loads include reaction forces.  
In the present problem, the horizontal force at node $C$ of magnitude $F$ 
is the given external load.
The reaction forces are not known, but we can determine them using 
equilbrium conditions for the whole truss structure. To write the 
equilbrium equations, we draw a free body diagram as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig9}-(a)
where $H_A, V_A$ and $V_B$ are the horizontal or vertical component 
of the reaction forces. The arrows in this figure indicate the direction of 
forces when the vector componets take positive values. 
With the foregoing notation, the equilbrium equations of the forces 
and moment are written as
\begin{equation}
	F+H_A=0, \ \ V_A+V_B=0, \ \ -F\times l\sin\frac{\pi}{3}+V_B\times l=0.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Note that the total moment about $A$ has been considered in the third equation.
Thus, we have 
\begin{equation}
	H_A=-F, \ \ V_A=-V_B=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}F
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Once we have obtained every reaction force, we're ready to determine the axial forces. 
For the analysis of the axial forces, it is convenient to number the truss members as 
shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig8}-(a), and denote the axial forces of the $i$th truss member 
as $N_i$ for $i=1,2$ and 3. Note that the tensile axial force is taken to be positive. 
If a tensile axial force is acting to a truss member, then the truss member is 
being pulled by the joints it is connected to. 
In other words, the truss member under a tensile axial force is pulling 
the joints at its end. This is a consequence of the law of action and reaction.
In the present situation, body A is the truss member and body B is the joint connected to.
To make things clearer, let's look at the truss member 1. The truss member 1 is connected 
to node A and B. Therefore, it is pulling the nodes A and B together if $N_1>0$. 
The same observation applies to the truss members 2 and 3. 
Figure.\ref{fig:fig9}-(b) shows the forces that act to each node (joints) of the truss. 
It should be noted that this figure depicts the forces acting to the node not the truss members.  
Since the truss structure including its joints is at rest, the set of forces 
applied to each joint must satisfy the equilbrium condition.
By imposing the equilbrium conditions for horizontal and vertical forces node by node, 
we can determine the axial forces. This procedure goes as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
	Node A: \\
	The equilbrium equations of the horizontal and vertical forces at node A 
	are written respectively as 
	\begin{equation}
		N_1+H_A+N_2\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_2\sin\alpha+V_A=0
		\label{eqn:nodeA}
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha=\frac{\pi}{3}$. Solving eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeA}), 
	we have $N_1=\frac{F}{2}$ and $N_2=F$. 
\item
	Node B: \\
	It follows from the equiribrium condtions for node B written as 
	\begin{equation}
		N_1+N_3\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_3\sin\alpha+V_B=0
		\label{eqn:nodeB}
	\end{equation}
	that we have $N_1=\frac{F}{2}$ and $N_3=-F$.
	We can verify that the axial force for member 1 from eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeA}) 
	agrees with that from eq.(\ref{eqn:nodeB}).
\item
	Node C: \\
	The equilbrium conditions for node C are written as 
	\begin{equation}
		F-N_1\cos\alpha+N_3\cos\alpha=0, \ \ N_2\sin\alpha+N_3\sin\alpha=0.
		\label{eqn:nodeC}
	\end{equation}
	Since we have already determined all the axial forces, 
	eqs.(\ref{eqn:nodeC}) are redundant.  
	However, it is a good practice to verify the solutions using a redundant 
	but independently derived relations that should be satisfied as well.  
	In the present problem, we can verify that our solutions $N_1,N_2$ and $N_3$ do 
	satisfy eq.(\ref{eqn:nodeC}).
\end{enumerate}
As it has been shown, two equations are availablle for every nodal point.
This means we can determine up to two axial forces per node 
based on the  equilbrium conditions. 
If more than two members are connected to a node, it is not possible to 
determine the axial forces of those members all at once as long as 
the nodal equilrium conditions are used exlusively.

\subsection{Solved Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Consider a simply supported bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_3}, and 
determine the reaction forces at support A and B.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig3_3.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported bar subjected to a vertical force of magnitude $F$i.}
	\label{fig:fig3_3}
\end{figure}
{\small
	The free body diagram of the simply supported bar is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig15}. 
	The horizontal and vertical components of the reaction forces are denoted in
	this figure as $H_A, V_A$ and $V_B$.
	The equilbrium equations for the reaction force compoents are 
	\[
		H_A=0, \ \ V_A+V_B=F, 
	\]
	and 
	\[
		-F\times a +V_B\times l =0
	\]
	where the last equation is concerned with the moment about $A$.
	From the set of equations above, we obtain
	\[
		H_A=0, \ \ V_A=\frac{b}{l}F, \ \ V_B=\frac{a}{l}F.
	\]
}
	\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig15.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A free body diagram of the bar shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_3}.} 
	\label{fig:fig15}
	\end{figure}
\item
Examine two support conditions shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_4}, 
and determine whether all the reaction forces and moments can 
be determined from the equilibrium equations. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig3_4.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A straight bar connected to (a)fixed supports, and (b) pinned supports.} 
	\label{fig:fig3_4}
\end{figure}
{\small
	The free body diagrams for the two support condtions are shown in 
	Fig.\ref{fig:fig16}. The total number of unknown reaction force components are  
	6 for (a) and 4 for (b), whereas the number of equilbirium equations 
	available are three. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the 
	reaction force components based only on the equilbrium conditions since 
	the number of unknowns is strictly greater than constraining equations.  
	When reaction forces can be determined from the equilbrium equations, 
		we say the structure is statically determinate. 
		Otherwise, the structure is called statically inteterminate.
	The structures shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_4} are the examples of 
	statically indeterminate structures.

	\end{center}
	\caption{The free body diagram for the bars shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3_4}.} 
	\label{fig:fig16}
\end{figure}
\item
	Determine the reaction and axial forces acting to the simply supported 
	truss shown in Fig.\ref{fig:13}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig13.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A simply supported truss structure.} 
	\label{fig:fig13}
\end{figure}
{\small 
	We first assign numbers to each turss member and draw the free body 
	diagram as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig14}.
	The equilibrium equations for the horizontal and vertical forces 
	are written as 
	\[ 
		H_A+F\cos\alpha =0 , \ \ V_A+V_B+F\sin\alpha=0
	\]
	where $\alpha=\frac{\pi}{4}$.
	If we evaluate the moment about $A$, the vanishing moment condition 
	becomes
	\[
		V_B\times l =0.
	\]
	since the line of action of the force at $D$ passes the node $A$. 
	We hence conclude 
	\[
		H_A=V_A=-\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}, \ \ V_B=0
	\]

	To determine the axial forces one by one, let's enumerate the 
	axial forces and illustrate all the forces that act to 
	every nodes as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig14}. 
	Again, the axial force of the $i$th member is denoted in 
	this figure as $N_i$ for $i=1,\dots 5$.
	Then we impose equilbrium conditions going through the nodes.
	But we need to start with the node for which less than or equal to 
	two unknown forces are involved. 
	If we start with node D, the equilibrium conditions first give us
	\[ 
		N_4=N_5=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}
	\].
	If we start from node A instead, the equilbrium condtions get us 
	\[
		N_1=-H_A=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}, \ \ 
		N_2=-V_A=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2}}
	\]
	Either way, the equilbrium equations for node C and D are made 
	solvable once one of the axial forces of the members connected to those 
	nodes have been determined. 
	For node C, require 
	\[
		N_5+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0, \ \ 
		N_2+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0
	\]
	whereas for node D
	\[
		N_4+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}+V_B=0, \ \ 
		N_1+\frac{N_3}{\sqrt{2}}=0
	\]
	are required. From the set of equations presented above, we 
	finally obtain $N_3=-F$.
