\section{Equilbrium of Force and Moment}
\subsection{Rotaional motion and moment}
Consider a perfectly rigid body $B$ subjected to a set of forces
\[ 
	\left\{\ \fat{f}_1, \fat{f}_2, \dots \fat{f}_{n} \right\}
\]
(see Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a)).
If $B$ is staying still under the loading, the Newton's 2nd law requires that 
the total force vanishes. Thus,
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \fat{f}_i = \fat{0}.
	\label{eqn:2nd_law}
\end{equation}
Note that eq.(\ref{eqn:2nd_law}) is a necessary and not a sufficient condition 
for the body to be in a static equilibrium. 
%A simple counter example for is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(b).
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig3.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{A body $B$ subjected to a set of forces $\fat{f}_i,(i=1\cdot n)$.} 
	\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}
To see this, consider a special loading condition shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}. 
Our experience tells us that the body start rotating upon loading the couple force 
 shown in this figure although the sum $\fat{f}_1+\fat{f}_2$ of the forces is zero.
This means the Newton's 2nd law \ref{eqn:2nd_law} only ensures that the loads
do not cause a translational motion. 
It is therefore necessaray to introduce an additional condition concerning rotational 
motion to complete the equilibrium condition for a rigid body. 
To do so, we have to device a way to measure the tendency that a given force to have on 
the rotational motion. 
\subsection{Moment}
The tendency that a force to rotatate a body about given point, or an axis,
is called moment. To define the moment based on our experience, imagine that 
a body $B$ is pinned on a wall at $P$ about which $B$ can rotate freely without 
friction (see Fig.\ref{fig:fig1}). If a vertical load $\fat{f}$ is applied to a point $A$ 
located on the same level as $P$, the body starts rotating in ithe clockwise direction.
If we're asked to rotate the body twice as hard, we'd probably either 
double the magnitude of the force, or slide the point of application twice as far from $P$ 
as illustrated in Figs.\ref{eqn:fig1}-(b) and (c).
This observation suggests that the moment should be proportional to the magnitude of the 
force and the distance between the loading point and the pivot.  
Thus, we may adopt the following as our first tentative definition for the moment $M$. 
\begin{equation}
	M=({\rm distance \, between \,the \, pivot\, and\, force) \times (magnitude \, of \, the \,force)}
	\label{eqn:def_M_temp}
\end{equation}
According to the definition (\ref{eqn:def_M_temp}), the moments about $P$ due the 
forces shown in Figs.-(a), (b) and (c) are evaluated as $r|\fat{f}|, r|2\fat{f}|$ and $2r|\fat{f}|$, respectively.

The definition works fine as far as the configuration shown in shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig1}.
To generalize the definition further, let's next inspect an obliquely applied forces
 shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig2}.
In this setup, the force is not vertically directed, and the pivot and loading points are on the different levels.
If we decompose the force vector $\fat{f}$, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig2} into the components parallell $\fat{f}_{\perp}$ 
and vertical $\fat{f}_\parallel$ to the line $l$ passing $P$ and $A$, we notice that $\fat{f}_{\parallel}$ does not 
contribute to the rotational motion about $P$. 
This means we need to consider only the vertical component $\fat{f}_{\perp}$ in defining the moment. 
Consequently, the present setup has been reduced to the previously inspected in Fig.\ref{fig:fig2}-(a).
Thus, we can now write the formula for the moment $M$ as 
\begin{equation}
	M=|\fat{r}|\times |\fat{f}_{\perp}|.
	\label{eqn:def_M_fp}
\end{equation}
Geometrically, eq.(\ref{eqn:def_M_fp}) gives the area $S$ of parallellogram $PABC$. 
The formula for $M$ is altanatively writen as
\begin{equation}
	M=r_\perp \times |\fat{f}|
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
where $r_\perp$ is the parpendicular distance from $P$ to the line of loading 
$l'$ depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:fig2}.
Finally, we incorprate a mechanism to distinguish a clockwise from counterclockwise 
moment into the definition of $M$. This is achieved by assigining positive 
and negative moments to the anticlockwise and clockwise moments as follows.
\begin{equation}
	M=\sigma S , \ \ \left(S= |\fat{r}|\times |\fat{f}_{\perp}|=r_\perp \times |\fat{f}| \right)
	\label{eqn:M_def}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
	\sigma=\left\{
		\begin{array}{cc}
			+1 & ({\rm counterclockwise}) \\
			-1 & ({\rm clockwise}) 
		\end{array}
	\right.
	,
	\label{eqn:sign}
\end{equation}
which completes our definition of moment.

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{fig1.eps}

%	\label{eqn:}
%\end{equation}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig2.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Oblique load acting on a body $B$.} 
	\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

In the previous class, we have learned the relationship between the vector 
cross product and the area of the parallelogram. In the present case, the 
it is written as 
\begin{equation}
	S=\left| \fat{r} \times \fat{f} \right|.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Thus, we can define the moment using the vector cross product. 
In using vector cross product, however, $\fat{r}$ and $\fat{f}$ have 
to be considered as vectors in 3D space. 
The most straightforward way of embedding the 2D vectors in 3D space is 
to pad zero to the third coordinate writting 
\begin{equation}
	\fat{r}=(x,y,0), \ \ 
	\fat{f}=(f_x,f_y,0).
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
Then the component-based formula of vector cross product yields the following. 
\begin{equation}
	\fat{r}\times \fat{f}=(0,0,xf_y-yf_x).
\end{equation}
We have thus obtained an alternative formula for $M$ as 
\begin{equation}
	M=\sigma \left| 
		xf_y-yf_x
	\right|.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we can verify that 
\begin{equation}
	M=xf_y-yf_x.
\end{equation}
since $\sigma$, or the rotatinal direction, has already been considered in the cross product.
The definition (\ref{eqn:M_def}) of the moment is valid only for 2D problem where 
rotational motion take places about an axisi with  predetermined direction. 
When we have to deal with rotational motion in 3D space, moment is defined as a vector 
quantity by the cross product
\begin{equation}
	\fat{M}=(M_x, M_y, M_z)=
	\fat{r}\times\fat{f}
	=
	\left(
		yf_z-zf_y
	,
		zf_x-xf_z
	,
		xf_y-yf_x
	\right).
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
This is not surprising because the axis of rotation can be directed in 
any direction in the three dimensional space depending on the loading condition. 
\subsection{Equilibrium Equations}
From the foregoing discussion, there should be two types of equilibrium conditions
for a rigid body. The one is the equilibrium of force and the equibrium of the 
moment is the other. Those are written as 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \fat{f}_i = \fat{0}, 
	\label{eqn:equib_f}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \fat{x}_i\times \fat{f}_i
	=
	\fat{0}
	\label{eqn:equib_M}
\end{equation}
where $\fat{x}_i$ is the loading point of $\fat{f}_i$.
It should be noted that $\fat{r}_i \times \fat{f}_i$ is the moment 
due to $\fat{f}_i$ about the origin of the coordinate. 
Equation (\ref{eqn:equib_M}) thus read 
"the sum of all moment about the coordinate origin is zero".
However, the total moment about an arbitrary point, say $\fat{p}$, 
should equally vanishes if the body is staying still. 
Thus, it seems necessary to write the equilbrium equation as 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\fat{x}_i-\fat{p}\right) \times \fat{f}_i = \fat{0}
	\label{eqn:equib_Mp}
\end{equation}
instead of eq.(\ref{eqn:equib_M}).
However, eqs.(\ref{eqn:equib_f}) and (\ref{eqn:equib_M}) imply eq.(\ref{eqn:equib_Mp})
because 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\fat{x}_i-\fat{p}\right) \times \fat{f}_i
	=
	\sum_{i=1}^n \left( \fat{x}_i\times \fat{f}_i  \right)
	- 
	\fat{p} \times \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \ \fat{f}_i \right), 
	\label{eqn:equib_Mp2}
\end{equation}
and by assumption the left hand side of eq.(\ref{eq:equib_Mp2}) vanish.
