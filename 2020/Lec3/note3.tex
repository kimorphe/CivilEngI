\section{Basics of Truss Structures}
\subsection{Introduction}
A bridge structure is an assembleage of plates, bars, and cables.
The parts making up the bridge structure are called structural members.
In this class, we're going to focus on slender bar-like structural members. 
By "bar", we mean a slender structural member for which an evident longitudinal 
axis exists. The cross sectional area of the bar can either be uniform or 
nonuniform in the longitudinal axis. By joining the bar-like members, we can 
build a structure called truss. Therefore, we will call the bar-like structural 
member as a truss member. Fig.\ref{fig:fig1} shows examples of truss stuctures. 
The truss structures shown in this figures bear the name of their inventors. 
Truss structures are characterized by a triangular assemblage of the members. 
The major advantage of the truss structure is the weight. 
Truss structures are often lighter in weight than girder bridges, which 
is the most prevalent bridge structure best suited to short-spanned bridges.
In designing truss structures, the first questions to be answered are
\begin{itemize}
\item
	How is the whole strctures supported ?
\item
	How to connect two or more structural members at the joints ?
\item
	How much force each truss member has to bear ?
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{center}
	\caption{Examples of truss structures. (a)Warren truss, (b) Howe truss, and (c) Pratt truss.} 
	\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}
Those are the issues discussed in this class. 
\subsection{Support Condition and Reaction Forces}
There are three support condtions that are basic in structural mechanics. 
Those are 
\begin{itemize}
\item
	fixed(or clamped) support,
\item
	pin( or hinge) support,and 
\item
	roller support.
\end{itemize}
In the followings, the three suppport conditions are explained
looking at the constraints that each support imposes to the 
body being supported. To this end, we do not have to be specific about the 
geometry nor the size of the supported objects. Therefore, we're going to 
study the support conditions for a single bar without loosing generaity.
\subsubsection{Fixed support}
When a bar is fixed perfectly to a rigid and immobile wall as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a), 
we say the bar is connected to a "fixed" or "clamped" support. 
At the fixed support, the translational and rotational motion are completely restraied. 
In the present example, the horizontal, vertiacl, and the rotational motion at the left 
end of the bar is completely fixed.
To see the action of the fixed support on the bar, suppose that the bar is loaded with
a vertical force as illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a).
The support (wall) should apply the forces and/or moment to the bar to restrain the 
dispalacement at $A$ and to hold the bar as in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(a). 
Such forces supplied by supports in response to the loading is called reaction forces. 
To see this more closely, assume that the bar is subjected to the reaction forces $V,H$ 
and moment $M$ at A (see. Fig.\ref{fig:fig3}-(b)).
Then the equilibrium condtions for horizontal and vertical forces conclude the following. 
\begin{equation}
	H=0, \ \ F-V=0 \ \ \Rightarrow V=F
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
If we evaluate the total moment about $A$, the equilibrium condition for the moment  
 is written as 
\begin{equation}
	M+F\times l =0 \ \ \Rightarrow M=-Fl.
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
We have not studied the way to impose moment without applying forces.
However, a pure moment of arbitrary magnitude can be generated by 
a couple forces shown in Fig.\ref{fig:fig6}. Note that the moment at the 
center of the couple force is evaluated to be 
\begin{equation}
	M=K\varepsilon, 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
while the sum of the coupled forces is zero. 
Thus we may generate the moment of arbitray magnitude by selecting 
 either $K$ or $\varepsilon$ withouth violating the equilbrium of forces. 
 Note also that we cannot determine both $F$ and $\varepsilon$ simultaneouslu, thus 
we should content with having only the moment. 
This is why we have drawn the reaction moment in Fig.\ref{fig:fig3} but not the couple force.

	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig6.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Generation of a pure moment by a couple force.} 
	\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Pin support}
The pin support fixes a structural member with a hinge around which the body may 
rotate frictionlessly. Since the support itself is fixed to an immobile floor 
or a wall, the displacement is not allowed in any direction at the support. 
This implies that the pin support applies the horizontal and vertical reaction 
forces in response to the external loading to the supported object. 
On the other hand, the reaction moment does not arise because the support would 
not prevent the object from rotatating at the hinge. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig7.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Pin supports installed on immobile floor and wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig7}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Roller support}
The roller support is considered as a hinge support mounted on a roller 
that can slide freely on a floor or a wall. 
It works in the same as the hinge support as far as the rotational motion 
 and the reaction moment are concerened. The roller support allows the supported object 
 to rotate without generateing a reaction moment. Moreover, it allows the displacement 
 in the direction that the roller may slide freely. If roller support is installed to a wall, 
 the vertical dipacelement is allowed while the horizontal is not. 
 In this case, therefore, the support can be a source of only the horizontal reaction force.
When the roller support is installed on the horizontal floor, the support 
 constrains the vertical motion while letting the horizontal displacement take place freely. 
This means the reaction force directs upward or downward and the horizontal 
reaction force is nonexistent.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig8.eps} 
	\end{center}
	\caption{Roller supports installed on immobile floor and wall.} 
	\label{fig:fig8}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Pin Connection}
Two or more truss members are usually connected either by a gasset plate or a hinge. 
The former type of connection is called a rigid connection where as the latter 
is called a pin connection.
At a rigid connection, the truss members are joined rigidly by a gasset plate.
This type of connection is considered rigid because the truss members are joined 
titely by the gasset plate that the angles between the truss members do not 
change upon loading. 
This means that the joint can transmitt a moment from one member to the other. 
At pin connections, on the other hand, the truss members joined by the 
hinges may rotate freely abount the joint. 
Thus the pin connected joint does not support a moment, and it does not 
transmitt the moment from one member to the other. 
The consequence is important in the analyses of truss structure. 

If we look at a truss member with rigidly connected ends, 
the force and the moments work on both ends. This is the case 
even thought the trusss member is not directly loaded by external forces. 
When the structure and the structural members are in static equilibrium, the 
equilibrium condtions must be met, which requires
\begin{equation}
	N_A-N_B=0, \ Q_A-Q_B=0, \  M_A-M_B+Q_Bl=0 
	\label{eqn:}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}
and thus we have
\begin{equation}
	N_A=N_B=N,\  Q_A=Q_B=Q, \  M_A-M_B=Ql.
	\label{eqn:sec_forces}
\end{equation}
where $N$ and $Q$ are called axial and shear force, respectively.
When the truss member is connected to pins at both ends, then 
$M_A=M_B=0$ by assumption. This reduces to eq.(\ref{eqn:sec_forces}) 
to 
\begin{equation}
	N_A=N_B=N,\  Q_A=Q_B=0, \  M_A=M_B=0.
	\label{eqn:sec_forces}
\end{equation}
This means that the truss members transmit only the axial forces 
 if they are connected both ends by hinges.
 As we will see, this simplifies the analyses of truss structures greatly.
