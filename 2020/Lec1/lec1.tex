\section{Review of Vector Algebra}
\subsection{Scalar and vector quantites}
A scalar is a quantitiy that has only a magnitude, while a vector has 
both magnitude(or length) and direction.
%The magnitude can either be positive or negative. 
The examples of scalar quantities frequently used in physics and engineering 
are mass, temperature, concentration, length, weight and so on.
%Vector is a quantity that has both a magnitude and direction. 
The examples of vector quantities are displacement, velocity, acceleration, 
force, heat flux, mass flux, electric poloarization, etc. 
It is sometimes useful to denote vectors by arrows typically when 
the gemterical relationship among the vectors is of interest.
In that situation, the length and directions of a vector 
are indicated by the length and the orientation of the arrow, respectively.
For a rigorous discussion and mathematical manipulations, however, symbolic 
representations of vectors are far more convenient. 
To denote vector quantities in typed manuscripts symbolically, boldface letters such 
as $\fat{x},\fat{u},\fat{v},\dots$ are used instead of writting simply as $x, u$ and $v$.
It is important not to confuse vectors and scalars since they are qualitatively different entities.
To denote the magnitude of vector $\fat{a}$, we either write $|\fat{a}|$ or simply $a$.
Unlike scalars, the magnitude of a vector is always greater than or equal to zero, i.e. $|\fat{a}| \geq 0$.
If $\fat{a}$ has a unit magnitude, namely $|\fat{a}|=a=1$, 
$\fat{a}$ is said to be a unit vector. If $|\fat{a}|=0$, it is said to be zero vector and written as 
$\fat{0}$. Note that the direction is not defined for $\fat{0}$. 
\subsection{Vector Identity}
Two vectors, say $\fat{a}$ and $\fat{b}$, are considered identical 
if their magnitude and direction are the same. 
In that case, we write $\fat{a}=\fat{b}$ regardless of their locations. 
If a pair of forces, say $\fat{f}$ and $\fat{g}$ of equal magnitude and 
direction $(|\fat{f}|=|\fat{g}|)$ are acting on two different points 
on a body, $\fat{f}$ and $\fat{g}$ are physically different but 
mathematically identical. 
The exception is a position vector. The origin of position vectors are always taken at 
the origin of a predefined coordinate.
This has been defined so because every spatial point has to be assigned uniquely to a position vector and 
vice versa.
\subsection{Basic Algebraic Operation on Vectors}
The most fundamental algebraic operations of vectors are scalar mutiplication 
and vector additions, which may be introduced as follows.
\subsubsection{Scalar multiplication}
A multiplication between a scalar $s$ and a vector $a$ are called 
"scalar multiplication" and is written as $s\fat{a}$. 
Scalar multiplication is an operation that gives us a new vector $s\fat{a}$ 
whose magnitude is $|s|$ times greater ($|s|>1$) or smaller $(|s|<1)$ than 
$|\fat{a}|$.
When $s>0$, $s\fat{a}$ points in the same direction as $\fat{a}$. 
When $s<0$, $s\fat{a}$ points in the opposite direction to $\fat{a}$. 
If $s=1$, the multiplication does vertiually nothing to $\fat{a}$, thus 
$1\fat{a}=\fat{a}$. For $s=0$, vectors of finite length are reduced to $\fat{0}$ by the 
scalar mutiplication $s\fat{a}$.
%Zero vector is a special vector whose length is zero. 
%The direction of $\fat{0}$ is indeterminate. 
\subsubsection{Vector addition}
Vector addition is an operation that produces a new vector by connecting a pair of vectors. 
If we let $\fat{a}$ and $\fat{b}$ be two arbitrary vectors, 
we can form a directed broken line by connecting the tail of one vector with 
the head of the other. The sum $\fat{a}+\fat{b}$ is defined to be a vector 
extending from the tail to the head of the broken line.
The direct consenquece of this definition is 
\begin{equation}
	\fat{a}+\fat{0} = \fat{0}+\fat{a}=\fat{a}. 
\end{equation}
Note that vector addition is "commutative" since 
\[
	\fat{a}+\fat{b}=\fat{b}+\fat{a}
\]
alwyas hold true. This means the order of summation may is immaterial and can be 
exchanged. Clearly, we can add more than two vectors by repeating the pair wise vectors addition.
For example, we can perform summation of three vectors either by 
\[
	\fat{a}+\left( \fat{b}+\fat{c} \right)
\]
or by 
\[
	\left( \fat{a}+\fat{b} \right) + \fat{c}.
\]
We can prove graphically that the addition by result in a same vector. Hence, 
\begin{equation}
	\fat{a}+\left( \fat{b}+\fat{c} \right)
	=
	\left( \fat{a}+\fat{b} \right) + \fat{c}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Inner (or Dot) product} 
\[
	\fat{a}\cdot\fat{b}=|\fat{a}||\fat{b}|\cos\theta
\]
\subsection{Exterior (or Cross) product} 
When a pair of vectors $\fat{a}$ and $\fat{b}$ make a right 
angle, they are said to be mutually orothogonal.  
\[
	\fat{a}\times \fat{b}= \fat{c}
	\Rightarrow
	\fat{a}\cdot\fat{c}=\fat{b}\cdot\fat{c}=0
	\left|c\right|^2=|\fat{a}|^2|\fat{b}|^2-\left(\fat{a}\cdot\fat{b}\right)^2
\]
\section{Newton's law of motion}
Newton's law of motion may be stated as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
	There exsist a coordinate system in which a body moves at a constant velocity as long as the 
	no force is exserted on it. Such coordinate system is called an "inertia system".
		(exsistence of an intertia system)
\item
	The time rate of change in the linear momentum of a body is equal to the force applied to the body. 
	This relation may be formulated as 
	\[
		\fat{f}=\frac{d}{dt}m\fat{v}
	\]
		where $m, \fat{f}$ and $\fat{v}$ denote the mass, force and velocity, respectively. 
	(convervation of linear momentum, or equation of motion)
\item
	If a body A is applying a force to the other and B are internacting, 
	The law of action and reaction.
\end{itemize}
